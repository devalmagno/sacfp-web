### Timesheet Management and Creation System

SGCFP, or "Timesheet Management and Creation System" is a comprehensive system developed to streamline the creation and management of attendance records. Created for the Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros, SGCFP automates the generation of '.docx' files, adhering to the university's attendance standards. This system encompasses a robust database housing detailed information on professors, ensuring efficient and precise management. Its implementation has notably enhanced the ease, speed, and accuracy of daily departmental tasks, providing a valuable tool for academic administration.

**Context:**  
The department was responsible for recording teacher attendance using manual timesheets, a process that was time-consuming and prone to errors due to the large number of subjects.

**Problem:**  
Manually creating timesheets for various subjects, each requiring at least 54 signature fields, was a laborious process, taking up to five days and being susceptible to errors.

**Solution:**  
I led the development of an application that stores and relates information about teachers, subjects, and class schedules, automatically generating the timesheets.

**Result:**  
The timesheet creation process was accelerated by over 80%, reducing the time from five days to one, and significantly decreasing errors thanks to the automatic data verification.
